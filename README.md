# CPS-SORTER

CPS-SORTER uses AsFault to generate virtual test scenarios for self-driving car software. It provides different experiments to test the performance of a machine learning model based approach for test selection.
The goal of using a model, is to identify unsafe scenarios before test execution allowing to reduce testing cost by avoiding safe scenarios.
